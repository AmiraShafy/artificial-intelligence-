 Advantages of Artificial Intelligence
1- Increased Efficiency
 For example, an AI tool may automatically recognize an incoming email as an invoice and send it to the right person or department,
 AI helps companies analyze data and generate reports as well, a well-trained algorithm can look at trends that humans may be absent,
 in addition to processing data much faster than people can alone.
 The organization's gains could also be as specific as determining how to increase energy efficiency,
 a recent project associated with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory includes the use of artificial intelligence to analyze more than 16 terabytes of data collected for several years,
 with the goal of improving energy usage, cooling efficiency and other aspects of data centers, as demonstrated by AI movies
 2-Improves Forecasting:
 Previously forecasting was a primarily experience-based effort, when forecasting customers' buying preferences or website traffic levels,
  Other methods required radar or satellite data, but this new approach only required weather station information Researchers said this aspect made 
  it ideal for places outside communication networks, and the technology also allowed for storm prediction before they formed.
 Enhances quality control:

 Opportunities abound for AI to help companies maintain high levels of quality, thus reducing waste and improving customer satisfaction.
 The team used artificial intelligence and computer vision to reduce substandard textile conditions by up to 90%,
 allowing factory managers to quickly identify and address problems
 Reducing risks Putting machines on tasks that could pose a danger to humans can pay off well. For example, enabling machines to deal 

 The flaws of artificial intelligence
1 - make people trust technology too much
 Artificial intelligence has made amazing gains, and it excels at some tasks compared to humans However,
 the downside is that people can become heavily dependent on what AI says and also not use their intelligence to draw conclusions,
 which is particularly worrisome as law enforcement and health care are two areas that use AI frequently.
 A user who allows technology to bypass its knowledge instead of continuing it may lead to false arrests or incorrect diagnoses.
 2- Shows biases
 
 Humans train AI algorithms and programming languages, and this may mean that they inadvertently bias applications or tools, one of the optimal
 The creditworthiness algorithm for Apple Card applicants, with many claiming to have been unfairly treated, 
 measures that in one case a woman was considered less creditworthy than her husband despite several factors in her favor.
 Apple was unable to explain the reason for this conclusion, although she maintained that gender was not a factor the algorithm entered into the analysis.
 AI-enabled machines do not understand morality Another human feature:

 that is difficult to integrate within the machine is morality.
