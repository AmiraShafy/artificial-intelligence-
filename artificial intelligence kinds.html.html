1-Reactive machines

The basic types of AI systems are fully interactive, as they do not have the ability to create memories,
 nor do they have the ability to use past experiences to report current decisions Deep Blue
 , the ideal model for this type of machine or device, the IBM chess supercomputer,
 which defeated the international defender Garry Kasparov in the late 1990s.

2-Limited momary
 This section of artificial intelligence includes machines that can look back,
 and examples of memory limited artificial intelligence machines range from IM robots in instant messaging applications etc.
 , virtual assistant applications in smartphones, to self-driving cars
 . These self-driving cars, for example, can observe the speed and direction of other cars, but cannot do so at once
 , requiring specific objects to be identified and observed over time, and then these observations are added to pre-programmed self-driving representations of the world,
 which also include track signs, traffic signals, and other important items, such as curves on the road they are traveling on.


3-Self aware
An important step in the development of AI systems is self-aware (Self-aware), a type of AI,
 where AI builds systems that can form perceptions of themselves, and yet does not go beyond the boundaries of self-aware AI,
 which means self-aware AI reaches a point too close to the human mind to realize its existence and self-conscious development
 . It is the ultimate goal of all AI research, since AI researchers will be able to understand consciousness and build machines that possess it,
 although it will still take decades or even centuries before it can actually be realized. 
 Self-conscious AI will not only be able to understand and stimulate emotions in those with whom it interacts, but also its own emotions
 needs, beliefs, and perhaps desires. This is in some ways an extension of the theory of mind ascribe to a third type AI For a reason.
