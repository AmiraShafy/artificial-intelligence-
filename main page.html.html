 Artificial Intelligence AI can be defined as the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks usually associated with intelligent devices,
 the term doubtedly beinung applied frequently to a systems development project granted to human intellectual processes, such as the ability to think, discover meaning
 , generalize, or learn from past experience. Without a doubt, since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s,
 it has been shown that computers can be programmed to perform very complex tasks,
 for example the discovery of proof of mathematical theories or the play of chess with great skill,
 and despite continuous progress in the speed of computer processing and memory capacity,
 there are still programs that can match human flexibility across broader fields or in tasks requiring much of daily knowledge.
  AI research is based on the future of machine learning and sophistication techniques to imitate human functions,
  thus the ability of AI systems to imitate humans is a criterion for determining types of AI,
  and their sophistication is measured by their efficiency in emulating human performance and functions in terms of diversity and proficiency, 
  and is considered the most advanced to the human level. Based on this standard, the types of AI are Reactive Machines.
